## About

A full stack MERN application for bar inventory management. Create a list of inventory items with corresponding counts and pars(the count required for one day of business sales). Get alerted when your counts run below your par and add them to an order list which can be exported as a PDF.

## Getting Started

Download or clone the repository [here](https://github.com/onieronaut/ebrius)

### Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

[MongoDB](https://mongodb.com)

### Installation

After downloading the repository and installing Node.js, use your command line interface to navigate to the directory the repository is located in and install the required packages with:

    npm install

Then navigate to the client folder and execute another

    npm install

## Usage

Once you have installed the required modules you can start a local server by running this line in your root directory in Node.

    npm start

A new browser tab will eventually open via React.

## Thoughts

I created this applicaton because of the many years I spent in the hospitality industry. A bar's main source of income is it's alcohol sales and I have seen many businesses go under because of lack of proper inventory management. In future releases I plan to add analytical insights into usage, broken down by product and type. I could also see this application being hooked up to a Front-Of-House POS system that would dynamically update the inventory counts as sales are made. With that amount of data this application would be able to tell the user precisely how much money they are making or losing based on their inventory methods.
